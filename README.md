2. Image Navigation
- Users can navigate through different sections of the puzzle image using buttons located at the top of the screen. Each button corresponds to a specific section of the puzzle.


3. Puzzle Grid
- The main section of the page displays the puzzle grid where users can drag and drop puzzle pieces. The puzzle grid is horizontally scrollable, allowing users to access different parts of the puzzle.


4. Draggable Puzzle Pieces
- Puzzle pieces are represented as draggable images. Users can long-press and drag these pieces across the puzzle grid. When dropped, the pieces snap into place based on predefined snap points, ensuring they align correctly with adjacent pieces.


5. Trash Can
